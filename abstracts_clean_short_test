Finite mixture models arise in a natural way in that they are modeling unobserved population heterogeneity It is assumed that the population consists of an unknown number k of subpopulations with parameters k receiving weights p pk Because of the irregularity of the parameter space the log likelihood ratio statistic does not have a limit distribution and therefore it is difficult to use the LRS to test for the number of components These problems are circumvented by using the nonparametric bootstrap such that the mixture algorithm is applied B times to bootstrap samples obtained from the original sample with replacement The number of components k is obtained as the mode of the bootstrap distribution of k This approach is presented using the Times newspaper data and investigated in a simulation study for mixtures of Poisson data

In the paper the equation of motion of the small amplitude transverse forced vibration of a radially prestressed and circularly clamped thin membrane has been developed The material of the membrane is considered to be homogeneous isotropic incompressible and viscoelastic From the analytical solution of this equation the incremental mechanical impedance of the membrane was derived as a function of frequency geometrical parameters and incremental viscoelastic coefficients of the material The parameters of the model were fitted to experimental impedance data using a global optimisation procedure to obtain the incremental viscoelastic moduli of the canine diaphragm The estimated quasi static behaviour of the model is shown to be consistent with the results  of experimental quasi static measurements It is concluded that the incremental viscoelastic moduli of a soft tissue and the stress dependence of these material coefficients can be determined by fitting the parameters of the model to the impedance data of that particular tissue

The embedding problem is to decide given an ordered pair of structures whether or not there is an injective homomorphism from the first structure to the second We study this problem using an established perspective in parameterized complexity theory the universe size of the first structure is taken to be the parameter and we define the embedding problem relative to a class of structures to be the restricted version of the general problem where the first structure must come from We initiate a systematic complexity study of this problem family by considering classes whose structures are what we call rooted path structures these structures have paths as Gaifman graphs Our main theorem is a dichotomy theorem on classes of rooted path structures
